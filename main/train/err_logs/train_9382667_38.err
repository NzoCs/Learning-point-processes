/gpfs/workdir/regnaguen/LTPP/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/loops/training_epoch_loop.py:221: You're resuming from a checkpoint that ended before the epoch ended and your dataloader is not resumable. This can cause unreliable results if further training is done. Consider using an end-of-epoch checkpoint or make your dataloader resumable by implementing the `state_dict` / `load_state_dict` interface.
